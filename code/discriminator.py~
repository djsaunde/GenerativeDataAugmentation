class Discriminator(ConvolutionalNetwork):
    '''
    This class encapsulates all the logic involved with the discriminator
    network. 
    
    Basically, the discrimator behaves like a normal classifier, except
    that it makes an additional prediction for whether or not the input comes
    from the training dataset distribution, or from the transformer network. 
    
    The discriminator tries to maximize the probability that it gets this distinction
    right, jointly with minimizing the classification error. We can, in fact, think
    of this together as minimizing a "more inclusize" classification error.
    
    In this implementation, we initialize the network with a ConvNet.
