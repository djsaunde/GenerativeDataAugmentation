Meeting (12/1) for 697L Final Project

- Understanding how adversarial training works
  -> minimax game
  -> transformer   ...maximizes probability of discriminator error
                   ...minimizes correlation input / output
  -> discriminator ...minimize error between training data / transformed data
  
- Next steps
  -> Explain projection / inverse projection transform architecture, why it's useful
  -> Explain affine - nonlinearity architecture as alternative
  -> Supervised training of adversarial pair
